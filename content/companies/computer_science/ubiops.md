UbiOps is a fast-growing software scale-up based in The Hague. With 20 young, creative and open-
minded colleagues from 10 different countries we have a mission to let every individual and
organisation activate, manage and share their data-driven intelligence.

UbiOps is a powerful yet easy-to-use platform for turning your Python and R code in live data-driven
applications in minutes. UbiOps offers you a feature rich deployment and serving layer for your data
science code, models and scripts. It dockerizes your code, manages all your dependencies, and
scales your deployments dynamically with the use of Kubernetes. UbiOps offers inference on CPUs
and GPUs. Go from local scripts to production grade applications with ease. Without having to worry
about security, reliability or scalability. UbiOps is used by individuals, start-ups, corporates and other
organizations such as Bayer, Hellofresh, Nationaal Cyber Security Centrum (NCSC), BAM Group,
Gradyent.ai and many others.

The platform is available as a ready-to-use SaaS solution (https://app.ubiops.com), but can also be
installed dedicated for customers on their own (public cloud, private cloud or local) servers. We offer
training, consulting and support services as well.

Our people are at the core of our success. Our fast-growing team consists of international young,
eager, ambitious, and smart people with various backgrounds who all share a passion for technology.
Our company is characterized by a culture of collaboration and taking ownership. This structure
encourages relationships based on mutual respect, trust, and honest feedback. We focus on the
empowerment and personal growth of our employees. Because we grow hard, move fast and
initiatives are embraced, you can have a great impact!
