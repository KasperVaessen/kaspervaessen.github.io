Each of our employees support the others by being willing and able to take part in individual coaching, training and knowledge exchange - but also by collaborating on an event concerning the subject matter in their field, or by relaxing together on a winter sports holiday.

ALTEN's core values include putting people at first, participating in knowledge networks, focusing on technology and being open and engaged. We strive to achieve the best results, and we do all of this with a great deal of enjoyment.
