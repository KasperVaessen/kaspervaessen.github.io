DRW is a diversified trading firm with over 3 decades of experience bringing sophisticated technology and exceptional people together to operate in markets around the world. We value autonomy and the ability to quickly pivot to capture opportunities, so we operate using our own capital and trading at our own risk.

Headquartered in Chicago with offices throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia, we trade a variety of asset classes including Fixed Income, ETFs, Equities, FX, Commodities and Energy across all major global markets. We have also leveraged our expertise and technology to expand into three non-traditional strategies: real estate, venture capital and cryptoassets.

We operate with respect, curiosity and open minds. The people who thrive here share our belief that it's not just what we do that matters, it's how we do it. DRW is a place of high expectations, integrity, innovation and a willingness to challenge consensus.

If you enjoy taking on new challenges and improving your craft, the opportunities at DRW are diverse, not only in the variety of products we trade, but in how our teams achieve their goals. As a firm who trades for our own accounts, we can be innovative and nimble in our approach to both trading and technology. Our teams are ambitious, yet pragmatic, and they are empowered to solve challenging business problems. And, weâ€™re hiring.
