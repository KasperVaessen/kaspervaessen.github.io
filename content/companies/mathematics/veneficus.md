Do you love data? We do! For more than 14 years we have been working with data and we
shared our love for data with a lot of high potentials. Now we want to share the love for data with
you!

Veneficus brings light to the overwhelming world of data & intelligence. As data scientist,
developers and engineers with a passion for data, there's nothing we enjoy more than making
others fall in love with it as well. By turning numbers into visuals, abstraction into ideas and code
into business plans. Veneficus uses the power of data by having the smartest people optimize
intelligence.

We work with the perfect mix of magic and logic. Blending data and creativity. Technology and a
human touch. Resulting in tools, advise and programs that help you develop, re-invent and grow
your business. For perfect flows, bigger growth, smarter working and, above all, happier lives.

We work in the following industries:
- Finance
- Insurance
- Retail
- Real Estate
- Energy
- Transport & logistics
- Etc.

Are you looking for a great start of your career? Or a challenging (thesis) internship? You can find us at the Career Orientation Day on the 4th of May. See you there!
