Our mathematicians break new ground by developing computational models of physical phenomena, helping to optimize ASML systems. Focus on data science and machine learning to deal with huge datasets or tackle model-based scanner control, parameter inference and more – the world of math at ASML is vast.
ASML is changing the world, one nanometer at a time! We’re a high-tech, Netherlands-based company manufacturing complex lithography systems that chipmakers use to produce integrated circuits – aka microchips.</description></item><item><title>Blue Radix</title><link>https://kaspervaessen.github.io/companies/mathematics/blue_radix/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 19:01:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kaspervaessen.github.io/companies/mathematics/blue_radix/</guid><description>Ready to solve major global challenges with algorithms?
Blue Radix creates automated intelligence for daily decisions in the greenhouse. With the continuous growth of the world population, the need for healthy food is increasing. The greenhouse horticulture business is currently scaling up on a global level. But this scale up cannot be achieved due to a lack of crop experts. At the same time, energy management is increasing in complexity. We have a solution for these worldwide challenges: our algorithm-based solutions offer growers a digital brain for their greenhouse.</description></item><item><title>Deltares</title><link>https://kaspervaessen.github.io/companies/mathematics/deltares/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 19:01:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kaspervaessen.github.io/companies/mathematics/deltares/</guid><description>Throughout the world, we work on smart solutions, innovations and applications for people, environment and society.

At DSW we prefer to create our own software applications. We hardly ever use ready-made programs. Our systems for processing healthcare expenses claims, for the registration of new clients or for robotics: our own people designed, developed and tested each and everyone of these. Are you interested in development, but still lacking the skills? No problem! We have our own training programs for C# and SQL to make sure you can quickly become a full-fledged member of our teams for developing applications.</description></item><item><title>ORTEC</title><link>https://kaspervaessen.github.io/companies/mathematics/ortec/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 19:01:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kaspervaessen.github.io/companies/mathematics/ortec/</guid><description>We are ORTEC, a purpose-driven organization changing businesses and society at large through the power of data-driven mathematical optimization.
